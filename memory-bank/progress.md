# Progress: bolt_adapt

## Current Status (Post-Architecture Improvements)

- **Overall:** Application is a partially functional PWA with core features implemented (Auth, Habit CRUD, Profile CRUD, Admin Habit Mgmt). Recently fixed the completion store architecture and established a plan for comprehensive architectural improvements.
- **Technology:** Confirmed stack: React, Vite, TS, Supabase (Auth, DB, Functions, Storage), Zustand, React Router, Tailwind.
- **Architecture:** Established core architectural principles (Separation of Concerns, Smart Caching, Single Source of Truth, Proper Hook Management, Error Recovery) and began implementing them starting with the completion functionality.
- **PWA:** Basic precaching via Workbox and push notification handling implemented. Lacks runtime caching and full SW lifecycle management.
- **Database:** Schema defined via migrations and types generated. Includes tables for profiles, habits, user_habits, habit_images, weight_entries, habit_comp_track, chat_messages. Uses JSON extensively for flexible fields.

## What Works (Based on Code Review and Recent Improvements)

- User Authentication (Sign In/Up, Password Change).
- Profile Management (Personal details, Weight tracking).
- Global Habit Management (Admin CRUD interface with image uploads).
- User Habit Tracking (Linking habits to users, marking completions).
  - **Recently fixed:** Completion tracking system with proper architecture, caching, and separation of concerns
- Basic PWA setup (Manifest, SW registration, precaching, push handling).
- Core routing and layout structure.
- Admin section guard (`is_admin` flag).

## Current Implementation Priorities

1. **Application Architecture Refactoring:**
   - **Global State Management:** Refactor all Zustand stores for consistent patterns, proper caching, and clear data flow
   - **Component Architecture:** Apply Container/Presentation pattern across all major features
   - **Data Fetching:** Create a unified approach to API calls with proper caching and error handling
   - **Error Handling:** Implement app-wide error boundaries and standardized error components
   - **Performance:** Audit and optimize React hooks, implement consistent memoization

2. **PWA Improvements:**
   - **Runtime Caching:** Implement strategies to cache API calls for better offline support
   - **Update Flow:** Add proper service worker activation logic for seamless updates

3. **Feature Completion:**
   - **Coaching Notes Admin UI:** Allow manual entry of coaching notes per user
   - **Chat Integration:** Integrate with the specified external chat platform
   - **Subscription/Payment:** Implement Stripe integration (deferred priority)

## Recently Completed

- **✓ Fixed CompletionStore Architecture:**
  - Implemented proper caching with timestamp and ID tracking
  - Eliminated infinite reload cycle by centralizing data loading in Home.tsx
  - Converted PlanTab to a pure presentation component
  - Established patterns for all future store implementations

- **✓ Established Core Architectural Principles:**
  - Documented best practices for component structure, data flow, and state management
  - Created plan for holistic application refactoring
  - Updated memory bank to reflect architectural improvements

## Known Issues / Areas Being Addressed

- **Architecture Issues (Being Addressed):**
  - Tight coupling between components and stores
  - Inconsistent state management approaches
  - Mixed responsibilities in components
  - Poor dependency management in React hooks
  - Lack of standardized error handling

- **Other Issues (To Be Addressed):**
  - Layout Calculation: Dynamic header padding calculation in Layout.tsx is brittle
  - Database Schema: Use of parallel arrays, naming inconsistencies, missing cascade delete relationships
  - Time Handling: Conversion between UI time format and DB evt_time format
  - Push Notifications: Configuration and authorization issues in Supabase function
