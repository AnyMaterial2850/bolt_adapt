## Problem Solved

*(Inferred - Needs User Confirmation)*
Helps users establish, track, and maintain healthy habits across different categories (Eat, Move, Mind, Sleep). Provides tools for goal setting, progress tracking (weight), and potentially coaching guidance to support behavior change.

## How It Works (User Perspective)

*(Inferred - Needs User Confirmation)*
1.  **Onboarding:** Users sign up for an account.
2.  **Goal Setting:** Users define their primary health goal and motivation (`goal_what`, `goal_why`).
3.  **Habit Selection/Configuration:** Users select predefined habits or create custom ones, configuring their frequency and schedule (`Habits` tab, `HabitConfiguration` page).
4.  **Daily Planning/Tracking:** Users view their scheduled habits for the day/week (`Plan` tab) and mark them as complete.
5.  **Progress Monitoring:** Users track their weight (`Profile` -> `Progress` tab) and potentially view other progress metrics.
6.  **Coaching:** Users receive notes manually added by a human coach via an admin interface (`Goal` tab).
7.  **Profile Management:** Users manage their personal details, account settings (password), subscription (deferred), and payment methods (deferred) (`Profile` page).
8.  **Chat:** Users interact with an AI chat agent provided by an external platform (Integration TBC).
9.  **Notifications:** Users may receive push notifications (e.g., reminders).
