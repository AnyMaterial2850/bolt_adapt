# Active Context: bolt_adapt

## Current Focus

- **Task:** Application Architecture Refactoring
- **Goal:** Implement a holistic architectural transformation to improve maintainability, performance, and reliability of the entire application based on principles derived from fixing the completion store.

## Recent Changes

- Fixed completionStore.ts infinite reload issue by implementing proper caching, dependency management, and separation of concerns
- Refactored PlanTab.tsx to be a pure presentation component, removing all data loading logic
- Updated Home.tsx to be the single source of truth for completion data loading
- Established core architectural principles for the entire application:
  1. Separation of Concerns (Container/Presentation pattern)
  2. Smart Caching Strategy with timestamps and tracking of loaded data
  3. Single Source of Truth for data loading
  4. Proper React Hook Management
  5. Error Recovery and Resilience
- Updated Memory Bank files to reflect new architectural principles

## Next Steps (Architectural Refactoring Plan)

1. **Global State Management Restructuring:**
   * Review and refactor all Zustand stores to follow established patterns
   * Implement consistent caching patterns across all stores
   * Add timestamp tracking and "dirty checking" to all data fetching
   * Create clear hierarchy of stores with well-defined dependencies

2. **Component Architecture Overhaul:**
   * Apply Container/Presentation pattern across all major features
   * Standardize component interfaces with TypeScript
   * Create shared component documentation

3. **Unified Data Fetching Strategy:**
   * Create centralized data fetching patterns
   * Implement request deduplication and caching
   * Standardize API response handling and error recovery
   * Add global loading indicators for all async operations

4. **Comprehensive Error Handling:**
   * Implement app-wide error boundaries
   * Create standardized error components with retry capabilities
   * Add centralized error logging and reporting
   * Design graceful degradation paths for all features

5. **Performance Optimization Framework:**
   * Audit and optimize all React hooks
   * Implement consistent memoization patterns
   * Add performance monitoring
   * Create guidelines for when to use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Prioritizing architectural improvements to enhance maintainability and performance
- Implementing changes gradually to maintain functionality throughout the refactoring process
- Starting with completion and habits functionality as the template for the architecture
- Considering future scalability in all architectural decisions
- Planning to refactor one domain at a time to minimize disruption
